OpenAI response for Prompt: Using artificial intelligence what is life 
 *************************



Life is the condition of existence that distinguishes living things from non-living things, such as plants, animals and other organisms. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and work like humans. AI has the potential to provide insights into the nature of life and to help us understand how life works. AI can also be used to create new life forms, or to modify existing life forms to better adapt to their environment.
