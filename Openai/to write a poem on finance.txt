OpenAI response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence to write a poem on finance 
 *************************



Money is a game of luck
The stock market's a rising tide
Where fortunes are made and lost
In one swift turn of the tide.

On Wall Street there's no guarantee
If you gamble, you may lose
Your risk may pay off, or you may find
Your wealth is fleeting, too.

The ups and downs of the market
A wild ride of highs and lows
The risk of losses and gains
Can be a source of woe.

But with the right strategy and foresight
You can make your financial dreams come true
The key to success in the market
Is to know when to pursue.
